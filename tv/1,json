IPTV providers can stream content in high definition (HD) and even ultra-high definition (UHD), depending on the user's internet speed and device capabilities.

        "link": "IPTV, or Internet Protocol Television, has a relatively short history compared to traditional TV broadcasting. Here's a brief overview of the history of IPTV: The early 1990s: The first IP-based TV networks were developed by companies like Precept Software and Vivo in the United States. These networks used IP multicasting to deliver video content over the internet. The late 1990s: The concept of IPTV began to gain momentum with the development of internet-based technologies and the widespread adoption of broadband internet. The early 2000s: Early versions of IPTV were developed by a number of companies, including Microsoft, which launched its IPTV platform in 2005. Other major players in the IPTV industry, including Cisco, Alcatel, and Ericsson, also began developing IPTV solutions. The mid-2000s: The first commercial IPTV services were launched, with the largest early adopters being telecom companies looking to offer triple-play packages (bundled TV, internet, and phone services). The late 2000s to present day: IPTV has continued to grow in popularity and has become a viable alternative to traditional TV broadcasting. Many cable and satellite TV providers have begun to offer IPTV services alongside their traditional TV offerings, and a number of standalone IPTV providers have emerged. Today, IPTV has become a major player in the TV industry, offering viewers more choice and customization options than ever before."
